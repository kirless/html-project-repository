<h2>Introduction </h2>
C++ is a programming language of high quality developed at Bell Labs by Bjarne Stroustrup. C++ applies object oriented features to its ancestor, C. C++ is one of the most common programming languages for graphical applications , for instance those running in Windows and Macintosh.
<h2>The definition of C ++ </h2>
It is an object-oriented, structured programming language. It was invented by Byarn Strästrup at Bell Labs. It is a language similar to the C language invented by Dennis Richie in the early 1970s, but it is safer than its predecessor and includes many modern technologies such as Object Oriented programming OOP. 2
<h2>History of C ++ </h2>
This language dates back to 1979, because it was terminated by Brian Strostrup while at Bell Labs. In fact he worked on it as an advanced version of the C language and was initially named (C with grades C with the classroom), 99% of the C programs work on it without changing the source code.

The name of the language was changed in 1983 to the name known as C ++. Over time, many features were added until it evolved and reached its current popularity.
<h2>C ++ language features</h2>
As a result of the interest in language since its inception, it was distinguished from its predecessors by many advantages that made it a prominent language among its likes. We will mention some of these advantages:

Object oriented language.
Portable.
Multiple tasks.
Inclusive.
Powerful, as it is used in many operating systems.
It is considered one of the leading languages ​​in the development of large and complex projects.
It inherited the advantages of C but added many important programming styles, such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, abstraction and classes.
It provides many functions related to functions and overload.
STL Standard Library provides algorithms, input and output units.
<h2>The disadvantages of C ++</h2>
There are some weaknesses or minor flaws in any language, perhaps, so we should mention it:

C Plus is not safe.
Complex for new learners.
Hard to handle and debug when used in web applications.
Garbage collection does not support resource restoration.
It does not provide much support for the programmer.
There are no virtual libraries of their own to design graphic interfaces
<h2>Some applications that have used C ++ in their design</h2>
This language has been used in many programs and applications that we use on a daily basis now, some of which relied heavily on the language, including what many languages ​​have combined to develop. But the strength of this language made it occupy a place in the programming of most successful and powerful programs, including:

Firmware: machine and mobile phone system software.
Operating systems such as Windows and Apple Os X.
Most Adobe software such as photoshop, Illustrator and Premier.
Google Applications: Some Google applications have been written by C ++, such as file system and Google Chrome.
Mozila Firefox Internet Browser.
3D modeling software Autodesk Maya.

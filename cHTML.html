<h4>2.<./Html> tag: used as a tag to permanently close text, and between start and close tags all descriptive tags and their properties are inserted into a webpage</h4>
<h4>3.<.head> <./head>: This tag is used to insert the rest of the tags between these two tags, where the <.head> tag is placed after the opening html tag, and the closing tag for it <./head> is placed before the end of the encoding text; Specifically before </html>.</h4>
<h4>4.<.title> tag <./title>: These tags come in succession without commas between them except for the title to be placed on the page, for example: <.title> what's is a html <./title>, and appears between the tag of the beginning and end of the title in the title of the web page .</h4>

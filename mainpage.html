<h2> Introduction </h2>
A programming language is a vocabulary and collection of grammatical rules for instruction to perform specific tasks on a computer or computing device. The word programming language usually refers to high-level languages such as BASIC , C , C++, COBOL, Java, FORTRAN, Ada, Pascal and others.

-- programming language has a specific set of keywords (words it understands), and a special syntax to organize instructions for the program.

<h2>High-Level Programming Languages</h2>
High-level programming languages are more complex than the languages which the computer actually understands, called machine languages, but they are simple compared to human languages. Each different type of CPU has its own unique language for machines.

Lying between computer languages and languages of the highest level are languages which are called assembly languages. Assembly languages are similar to machine languages but are much simpler to program in because they require a programmer to substitute numbers with names. Computer languages are composed only of numbers.



Lying above are languages of the fourth-generation (usually abbreviated 4GL) languages. 4GLs are far from the computer languages and represent the class of computer languages closest to human languages.

<h2>Converting to Machine Language</h2>
Whatever language you use, you must eventually convert your program into a machine language so that the computer can understand it. This can be done in two ways:
1) Compile the program.
2) Interpret the program.
The problem of which language is best amongst computer professionals is one that consumes a lot of time and energy. Each language has its weaknesses and strengths. For example, FORTRAN is a particularly good language for processing numerical data, but organizing large programs doesn't lend itself very well. Pascal is very good at writing well-structured and functional programs, but it is not as versatile as the language of C programming. C++ embodies mighty object-oriented features, but it is complex and difficult to learn.
